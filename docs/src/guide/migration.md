# Migrating to Vite

If you would like to add a note about other setups, pull requests are welcome!

## Starting Fresh ‚òÄÔ∏è

When starting a new project, follow the [guide], and you should have a [basic setup][sourceCodeDir]
where you can place your JavaScript, stylesheets, and other assets.

## Sprockets ‚öôÔ∏è

If you would like to remove sprockets and use Vite Ruby alone, you can [follow this example][sprockets example].

Have in mind that this is optional, as both approaches can coexist without issues.

## Webpacker üì¶

When migrating from [Webpacker], start by following the [guide] to get a [basic setup][sourceCodeDir] working before proceeding to migrate existing code.

During installation, Vite Ruby detect if the `app/javascript` directory exists,
and use that in your `config/vite.json` instead of the [default][sourceCodeDir].

```json
{
  "all": {
    "sourceCodeDir": "app/javascript",
    ...
```

:::tip One entry at a time
The recommended approach for medium-to-large-sized applications is to migrate
one entrypoint at a time if possible. Gradually move each [file][entrypoints] in `app/javascript/packs` (managed by Webpacker) to [`app/javascript/entrypoints`][entrypointsDir] (managed by Vite Ruby).

Check [this migration from Webpacker](https://github.com/ElMassimo/pingcrm-vite/pull/1) as an example.
:::

Proceed to fix any errors that occur (i.e. differences between Webpack and Vite.js) by checking the _[Troubleshooting]_ section and the following __recommendations__:

- Explicitly add a file extension to any non-JS imports.

  ```diff
  - import TextInput from '@/components/TextInput'
  + import TextInput from '@/components/TextInput.vue'
  ```

- Replace usages of [tag helpers] as you move the [entrypoints].

  ```diff
  + <%= vite_client_tag %>

  - <%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>
  - <%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>
  + <%= vite_javascript_tag 'application' %>

  - <%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'mobile' %>
  + <%= vite_stylesheet_tag 'mobile' %>

  - <img src="<%= asset_pack_path('images/logo.svg') %>">
  + <img src="<%= vite_asset_path('images/logo.svg') %>">
  ```

- Replace `require.context` with [`import.meta.glob`][glob] or [`import.meta.globEager`][glob].

  ```diff
  - const context = require.context("./controllers", true, /\.js$/)
  + const controllers = import.meta.globEager('./**/*_controller.js')
  ```

- If importing code that is located outside of the <kbd>[sourceCodeDir]</kbd>, make sure to add a [glob expression] in <kbd>[watchAdditionalPaths]</kbd>, so that changes to these files are detected, and trigger a recompilation. 

- If you were using <kbd>[rails-erb-loader]</kbd>, you might want to check <kbd>[vite-plugin-erb]</kbd> to ease the transition, but it's better to avoid mixing ERB in frontend assets.

- Make sure <kbd>[npx]</kbd> is available (comes by default in most node.js installations), or [clear][clear rake] the <kbd>[vite:install_dependencies]</kbd> rake task and provide your own implementation.

::: tip Loaders to Plugins
Vite provides many features [out of the box], which reduce the
need for configuration.

In complex setups, the app might depend on specific webpack loaders, which can't
be used in Vite, which uses [Rollup] under the hood.

Check [Vite Rollup Plugins] and [Awesome Vite] to find equivalent plugins.

## Assets üé®

It's recommended that you locate assets under the <kbd>[sourceCodeDir]</kbd>,
which requires no additional configuration. You can use [import aliases] to
easily reference them.

However, during a migration it can be convenient to reference files that are
still being used through the [assets pipeline], such as fonts in `app/assets`.

In that case, you should add [`app/assets/**/*`][glob expression] to <kbd>[watchAdditionalPaths]</kbd> to track changes to these files and trigger a rebuild when needed.

In order to reference these files it's highly recommended to [define][resolve.alias] your own [import aliases]:

```js{7}
import { resolve } from 'path'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@assets': resolve(__dirname, 'app/assets'),
    },
  },
})
```

Remember to update any references to these files, for example, in
stylesheets processed by Vite:

```diff
@font-face {
  font-family: 'OpenSans';
- src: font-url('OpenSans.woff2');
+ src: url('@assets/fonts/OpenSans.woff2');
}
```

Once you have finished the migration, you can move all assets under <kbd>[sourceCodeDir]</kbd>:

```diff
@font-face {
  font-family: 'OpenSans';
- src: url('@assets/fonts/OpenSans.woff2');
+ src: url('@/fonts/OpenSans.woff2');
}
```
